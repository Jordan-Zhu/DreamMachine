Changes made:
- Header file runs parse(); instead of program();
- parse function initializes the symbol_table array and the instruction (PM/0) code array 
	and calls program()

TO-DO (imo):
- Create data structure storing values of opcode instructions and their numeric values
(numbers for assembly functions are from ISA) (e.g. LOD is 3 and STO is 4).
(enum assigns every value a number, so maybe use an enum for this?)
- Keep track of the level
- Enter constants and variables into symbol table.
The thing with enter() is sometimes it needs different amounts of parameters beyond
variable type and ident name. 
- other things I'm forgetting


---------------------------------------
Main method is contained in compile.c and a makefile generates the execuatble file ./compile
by compiling and linking compile.c and additional files

To run parser:
Executable file accepts two command line arguements as follows:

	./compile <input> <output>

where <input> is the name of the file containing the PL/0 code and
<output> is the name of the file containing the PM/0 code generated by the compiler.
